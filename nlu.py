My company has an office in SF so I travel to SF every month. I used to stay at hotels. Since the first time I stayed with Patrick I never booked any hotels anymore. I love the neighborhood and Patrick is one of the nicest hosts that I have met. I would suggest people take his breakfast when you will get a chance to chat with him. It feels like home.
 Cutest, friendliest puppy on the planet. PERFECT A truly wonderful space and a nice kind host. I'm really happy to have chosen Patrick's as a place to stay. I would enthusiastically recommend his hospitality to anyone who was thinking about staying in his gorgeous home. Patrick is an incredible host! He's very warm, helpful, kind and has a most gorgeous apartment! I mean really gorgeous. His sense of taste is exquisite. He was incredibly welcoming and we really felt at home. The room itself is beautiful-elegant and peaceful and true Zen experience. The location itself was fabulous as well, right near everything, but not on top of everything so you really feel like you have space. All in all, I can't recommend staying with Patrick highly enough!! Patrick has possibly ruined me for any future airbnb experiences! I can honestly say that the 4 days the BF & I stayed w/Patrick was incredible. Communication was easy & frequent, his flat is easy to reach from SFO (BART to Civic Ctr, then a $10 cab or a 10min bus), and then we were greeted w/freshly-baked apple pie (YUM!!!) & Fanny, the super adorable (non-yappy!) dog. The room + ensuite were impeccable: lots of light, storage, great water pressure, fluffy towel sets, guidebooks if needed and the bed was a dream from the mattress to the sheets/pillows. Everything was exactly per the pictures! Location is very central: 2 Caltrain lines & 3 bus routes w/good connections are w/in 5 blocks. If you're not averse to walking, it's a couple easy miles to Union Square. Parking can be a bit of a nightmare unless you have a compact! We took advantage of Patrick's continental breakfast & had some great conversations together. He was also very flexible with our arrival & departure times which were both later in the day. You absolutely cannot go wrong staying w/Patrick! My sister and I had a wonderful stay in Patrick's beautiful home.  Patrick was hospitable and friendly, very willing to give us advice and recommendations on restaurants to visit.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would happily return! Patrick was a gracious host and made us feel at home and welcome from the moment we arrived. He was ready and willing to help us plan our stay and figure out how to get to where we were going. In fact, I would definitely recommend staying here to people who have never been to San Francisco before. Patrick knows a lot about the city and would probably be the best advisor to seeing the city's best. Our only regret is not staying longer!! Patrick and his cute dog Fanny were great hosts. The appartement is really beautiful and the location perfect to visit most neighborhoods by foot. I'd rate 6 stars for cleanliness if I could. The place was immaculate and exactly as in the photos, and Patrick was very friendly, respectful and responsive to our needs. I'd stay here again if I had the chance. Patrick ha sido un anfitrión genial. Nos ayudó a la hora de alquilar nuestro coche y también nos recomendó lugares a visitar en SFO. Su casa está muy limpia y es tranquila y acogedora.
Si volviéramos a SFO iríamos de nuevo a su casa. Patrick's Lower Haight home is a true serenity place. We enjoyed the San Francisco "local experience." My fiancee and I stayed for 3 nights. Patrick is an excellent host... We had a pleasant time. I recommend this place! Thank you Patrick Patrick is a very nice and tasteful guy and his amazing home reflects his personality.  The room is nicely furnished, clean and very comfortable, with an en-suite bathroom that gives you total privacy. Location is also good, not far from the most touristic places but situated in a charmful and quiet neighborhood. We definetly recommend Patrick's house to anyone should plan a visit to SF. It was my first experience with airbnb and it has been great! Patrick is a delicious host and very helpful for touring and enjoying San Francisco. The room is very good as well as the neighborhood. I would really suggest it! Simply the best! I wish we had more time to spend with Patrick but our time was short and sweet. This was a great experience, his home was amazing as was he. The home is located close  to the bus number 21 that takes you straight into the center of SF and the pier. Great artwork and wooden floors. The private bathroom was great, we especially liked the tiles that looked reflective like oysters against a torqoise background. Great breakfast and conversation... Finally the little doggy was a cute addition to the home :) Patrick & his cute dog have a welcoming home.
He is an enthousiastic helpful host and our room has all the comfort you may need. It is definitely a nice place to stay and remember! My partner and I spent three days at Patrick's place and we couldn't hope more for our very first Airbnb experience.

Everything was just as described if not even better - Patrick is a wonderful host and his home is exquisitely designed and furnished. Very close to public transports and lovely cafes and restaurants staying at Patrick's will make a perfect base to explore the city.

We would definitely come back if visiting San Francisco again! We stayed for 5 nights at Patrick's beautiful house. It's located in one of the nicest neighborhoods in SF. The room was comfortable and very clean. The pictures shown on this website gives you a really good impression of what it looks like.
Patrick welcomed us with a nice cup of tea and showed us some highlights of the city on the map.
During our stay he was also around for a nice chat. Fanny is a really cute dog which doesn't bark of anything like that. We loved our stay here and we'll definitely recommend it to anybody who is looking for a great local experience in San Francisco.
 100% perfect! Patrick is a perfect host and his place is amazing too! in a very cozy district with plenty of bars and restaurants. we stayed for 3 night and we would absolutely ask him to be his guest again.  An excellent location with lots of bars and restaurants nearby and good transport links. Patrick was a very welcoming host for the two nights that we stayed with him and his very cute little dog Fanny. The apartment was very homely and exceptionally clean (the cleanest Airbnb accommodation we have stayed in). I think that we stayed in the smaller of the rooms and we did find it a little tight trying to get in and out of our enormous suitcases.  There is however a small walk in wardrobe to store your belongings if you are staying for a little longer and wish to have more bedroom floor space. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to others. My boyfriend and I had a nice stay with Patrick! This room is very much like a hotel. Clean and comfortable. Got great restaurant recommendations from Patrick and thoroughly enjoyed all of them! We walked most of Haight/Ashbury and then took the bus downtown to see the sights. Would definitely recommend staying here. We loved staying with Patrick. The apartment is beautiful and clean and Patrick is such a nice and easy-going host. The neighborhood is very nice as well, lots of cute little cafés and brunch places and very quiet and safe. The room is tiny but very cute and comfortable and of course it's nice to have your own bathroom. You really can't go wrong staying there.  The home was just as the photos showed. Patrick was welcoming and we felt comfortable even as first time airbnb users. The house was clean, welcoming and expertly decorated. The location/neighborhood  was perfect for our visit.  It's been said many times before in Patrick's reviews. His home is a wonderful place to stay: clean, well appointed, en suite bathroom, peaceful yet very convenient to public transit and many good restaurants. We highly recommend this as a place to stay in San Francisco. Patrick is a wonderful host and his home is beautiful. The bedroom was clean and comfortable. Great AIRBNB host.  Patrick is a marvelous host, and his home is lovely, immaculate, tasteful and charming.  The neighborhood was perfect, since we were able to walk to most places we wanted to visit.  The bus line was convenient, too.
This room was a bit small for two, but would be ideal for one.  Ask about the larger room if you're a couple, which is more spacious and airy.  We'll ask for that one next time. I'm sure we'll be back! GREAT location! The apartment is lovely and relaxing (not to mention great value). Patrick is also fantastic. He was very helpful and easy to communicate with. I would highly recommend staying here.  Patrick was a pleasant, responsive host. His location was clean, attractive, and orderly and in a very quiet location. It is very close to public buses and food shopping. The bed was very comfortable, and reading in his living room was a pleasure.
I would stay here again. I had a nice stay at Patrick's home. He made me feel very welcome and was happy to help with any questions I had. His home itself is very nice  - clean, spacious, and tastefully decorated. The location is great and it's close to some nice parks as well as the MUNI (public transportation) which is great for getting around. I would recommend it to anyone considering it.  Patrick is a sweetheart, my stay was perfect. We danced, we talked, he gave tips, he even helped out on the ticket i got with my car. Furthermore, he is quiet and lively, the room is quiet and beautiful, the dog Fanny is quiet too. Oh and Patrick has an excellent taste. He is a designer too. He helps with everything and is always reachable and replies quickly. May be he is just the perfect host! Enjoy your stay,  Im sure you are in good hands with Patrick Words cannot describe how perfect Patrick + his place are! From his warmth to his wisdom, he truly has all the great qualities of an excellent host, plus the sweetest pooch around... Everything about our stay was incredible - from the cool yet cozy feeling of his casa to the amazing suggestions + ideas he gave us.  We all had inspiring conversations & lots of laughs!  Would give him 10 stars if we could, 100% happy about having stayed there, we truly can't wait to go back!!!  He truly sets the standard for what an airbnb experience should be like.  Thanks so much + Namaste!  : ) If I could rate this with a sixth star, I would! Patrick was warm, friendly, and very accommodating with our crazy travel schedule. Every inch of his home is beautifully decorated, including the room we stayed in. Patrick provided us with a dozen maps and guides that proved to be vital throughout our exploration of the city. If we visit the city again, we will definitely choose to stay here. If you're not as familiar with the city, Patrick's home is in a perfect location for getting around via public transportation. A truly Zen place. It wasn't just clean and comfortable (though it was that)--it was atmospherically akin to a spa. The neighborhood is nice, hip, and convenient, and for his help and chill vibes we're very grateful to Patrick (and his little dog, too).  Patrick's apartment was clean, quiet, and conveniently located to many attractions and public transit lines. As a host, Patrick was very kind and courteous - he welcomed us when we arrived and gave us suggestions on places to see and how to get there. We brought a car with us for the first few days and found it easy to park on neighborhood streets for free, but if just exploring the city, it really isn't necessary because of how many different MUNI lines are within walking distance. The room was a little small, but it was very comfortable to sleep in and there was a dresser and closet for us to store clothes in. We used the internet occasionally and it was easy to connect to. Would definitely stay here again!  We had the an outstanding weekend in San Francisco and Patrick's home was the perfect retreat between activities.  Our room and the entire home were both pristine.  The decor was worldly, warm, and inviting.  The location seemed to be ideal.  We wanted to move in!  Patrick was a great host.  He made us feel welcome and offered several suggestions for food and drinks in the neighborhood.  I wouldn't have changed a thing.    We've stayed with Patrick and Fanny for three nights. The place they share is clean, quiet and within walking distance of public transportation. Patrick was a lovely host, asking how our day was, what were our plans and willing to help us at anytime. He certainly made our stay unforgettable. Thanks and hope to see you in Argentina! Estuvimos cinco noches en la casa de Patrick y fue una gran experiencia. Estar en un lugar tan cómodo y agradable nos ayudo a que nuestra estadía en San Francisco fuera inolvidable. Patrick es un gran anfitrión. Es discreto y amable, se preocupa por las necesidades de sus huéspedes y comparte su casa con naturalidad y alegría.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! The room is as described: very clean, quiet, and well decorated. The bed is comfortable. The house itself is tastefully decorated, and the little dog Fanny is cute and calm.
Patrick was a very nice host, very helpful and discreet.
The neighborhood is very central, with shops and restaurants nearby, yet the street is quiet and peaceful.
Patrick was very helpful in giving us suggestions and directions. Would definitively go back here on my next trip to San Francisco. Thanks, Patrick! Patrick made my first airbnb experience one that will be hard to match! I can't praise his hospitality enough - he is a fantastic host, and made me feel completely welcome. Before and during my stay he was communicative and kind. And, as has already been said a lot in these reviews, his home is incredibly beautiful. The room itself was perfect for me (including the extremely comfortable bed). I spent an entire day walking around the areas around his house, which included Golden Gate Park, the Painted Ladies, the Mission and Castro districts, and lower Haight itself - all within easy walking distance. In closing: if you can possibly stay with Patrick when in SF, I thoroughly recommend that you do ! Patrick was a wonderful and accommodating host! His home is beautifully decorated, and the room is tidy and comfortable. Highly recommended! What a lovely place to stay in San Francisco! We really felt like home in this cosy and tranquil room, even if it was a short layover.. Patrick is a perfect host! Thanks a lot!! Ines & Andy Patrick's place was great, as was Patrick. It's a convenient location (easy to get to from airport and to explore various neighborhoods) and Patrick is very friendly, easy going and accommodating. We arrived quite late and had to leave for an early flight and this was no problem. The room is comfortable, with its own on suite, kitchen has everything you need (including coffee, tea, fruit). We would definitely stay with Patrick again and SF is a great city, too.  We spent 4 nights in Patrick's home. The room was clean and tidy, his house is very beautiful and well located, and Patrick is a very nice guy, very helpful, we had very good times in San Francisco thanks to him. Patrick is a sweetheart, what more can I say? And he *does* have a very cute doggie. The lodgings were classic SF downtown, meaning a small but cozy room in a large Victorian house. The interior was very luxuriously updated, lots of natural woods and Asian decor. The road was very peaceful too - you can even hear birds chirping, which can be rare in a big city. The bed was very comfortable and clean as well.

My *only* complaint was that it was too difficult for my to get the shower working due to a sticky knob (I am not that strong) - but Patrick was very responsive in helping me with the issue.

This is also a convenient location to the 22 bus and only about a quarter mile to the train lines too, but I'd recommend giving yourself extra walking time due to irregular schedules and a lack of signs telling one where to go/stand! Patrick was an excellent host. Shared lots of tips and was extremely hospitable. Home was very clean, with interesting decor. The only issue we had was during check-in, as no one was there to let us into the building when we arrived, and we had to stand on the street with all of our stuff. After that was sorted out - we had an amazing stay and would stay with Patrick again in future. Staying at Patrick's place was a great experience and I would recommend it to anyone finding themselves in San Francisco!

The bedroom is cozy, has it's own bathroom and the bed is very comfortable. The entire apartment is very clean, organized, and great overall.

The apartment is very close to bus lines that go easily to turistic points and also to other interesting neighborhoods, such as Mission and Castro. It's also walking distance to plenty of other places like the Haight, Alamo Square, and Golden Gate Park.

Patrick is super friendly and being a SF native, is full of good tips about things to do/see and places to get great food.  He's even got some guidebooks and maps that can help you explore the city.

 This place is perfect to stay in when you are in San Francisco! The bedroom and bathroom are very clean and well appointed as is the whole house.
Patrick was easy to communicate with and always there to help out.
We would definitely stay there again, highly recommended! A beautiful home in a funky (in a good way) neighborhood. Lots of nice coffee places, shops and a great BBQ place just around the corner.

I've enjoyed my stay at Patrick's a lot. Since he was on a business trip his niece took care of everything, she was super friendly and helpfull. Patrick was helpful and very welcoming. The room was smaller than I initially expected, but clean, with a spacious closet. The house makes up for the room, as it is well decorated and very spacious...and I must say that I found the location ideal for touring SF. I would most definitely recommend Patrick's home, it was well worth it...not to mention his puppy is the sweetest!  I would definitely stay there again if given the opportunity. We stayed 4 nights at Patrick's place and we had a great time. Nice room and bathroom with everything you need. The location is perfect. You have everything close: bus and metro stops, restaurants, parks, shops. Patrick helped us and gave us tips with everything and we would definitely pick Patrick's place again for a future stay :) Quite, peaceful and in proximity to everything a tourist needs and has greats hosts! We have had a great time in San Francisco. We were very lucky to choose it and we will definitely stay there again when we return. Overall my experience at Patrick's home was very positive and I would not hesitate to repeat it. His was truly accommodating in letting me check in early as well as leave my luggage for the better part of the check-out date so that I good get in some more sightseeing . In both cases- checking in early and checking out late- he showed not discomfort in allowing me the keys beyond the stated times. I appreciate very much this honor system, which factored into final decision to forgo a hotel. Additionally, Patrick welcomed me to the use of the kitchen as well as the living area without a litany of restrictions. The neighborhood which is mostly quiet and residential is very well located as far as public transportation and is interesting in itself as far as its historical homes and a bohemian feel a short walk from the house which transitions in another direction to a more gentrified neighborhood leading to the University of San Francisco. The only drawbacks if they could be considered such would be the lack of TV, which far from essential, might be a perk for those curious about the local
broadcasting.  Also perhaps too minor to mention is that there is another guest room. If you are a light sleeper and the other guests are up and about before you are, then there is the possibilty of being awakened a bit early. But I stress that this is more of an issue with those having sleep sensitivities than with the lack of noise control on the part of the owner as it is clear Patrick screens his lodgers. To repeat, a very memorable experience indeed.  Great experience! Patrick's place is very clean, fairly quiet and located in a convenient central location close to Mission area, Castro, Haight/Ashbury, Hayes Valley, etc. Public transportation to pretty much everywhere is very close by. We appreciated the extras such as chatting with Patrick about restaurants and which areas to check out, and also the reasonably-priced ride to the airport if Patrick is available. Jogging in the Panhandle (and Golden Gate Park) was a treat and is also very close. Just prepare yourself for some hill work! Fanny is friendly as can be and we'd stay here again! What an incredible apartment! Patrick has impeccable style and is a thoughtful host. We were running late the day we arrived and Patrick was easy to communicate with. The room is exactly how it appears online. Crisp, clean, and so quiet at night. The location was great, only a 15 minute walk from Mission, and in a nice residential area. We would definitely love to stay here again if we ever return to San Francisco.  The house is perfectly located. It was beyond clean, beautiful and very cozy. I would highly recommend this place and would like to come back anytime. Patrick is a great host and so is his cute dog Penny. We have a wonderful stay with them. The room decorated with a good taste, cozy, quite and clean. One will feel very peaceful in Patrick's. We of course highly recommend the place to all people who want to find a nice stay in SF. Thank you Patrick. We really enjoyed our stay at Patricks place. It was our first airBnB experience so we were very excited how it's going to be. This place was really perfect: very cosy, clean and beautiful decorated. Patrick was really friendly - we liked chatting with him and he provided us with maps, informationbooks about the area and recommendations for local restaurants which were really good. Also his little dog Fanny was really cute :-)  This place is highly recommended!  Our stat with Patrick was great! The place was really nice and clean! The apartment is located in a perfect spot to explore San Francisco. I would definitely stay with Patrick again!  My partner and I only stayed here for 3 days but had an amazing time. Patrick's place is so convienitely located, you could walk everywhere.  We loved staying at Patrick´s house! He's a great host, very good adviser and his place rocks. We had the small room but it was very comfy with prv bathroom that´s perfect. And the neigborhood is awesome! Thanks we will come back! We've had a wonderful experience at Patrick's visiting San Francisco. His home is situated min. from the hippie Haight & Ashbury district, Downtown (Market St) and Golden Gate Park to the west is just 15-20min bus ride away. The location is truly convenient.
The room provided is as he photographed in the ads, it's rather smallish but only 'cuz we asked for the one with private bath.
Patrick wasn't there during our stay, but let us use his kitchen wares during our stay so it truly was just like at home.. Overall, we ranked our experience very positive and would recommend to anyone. We a great time . apartment and bedroom are really lovely . the welcome was very warm . I recommend this bed and breakfast . Fantastic location, easy check in and check out. We would come again :) My boyfriend and I stayed in Patrick's place for the weekend.  Our experience was amazing!! His house is beautifully decorated with many souvenirs from his travels.  For those of you worried about privacy (like my boyfriend was), don't worry about a thing!!  We had our privacy throughout our entire stay.  Checking in was super easy and Patrick's cousin was able to work with our schedule.  We had our flight delayed 2.5 hours and arrived to the house past midnight but she was more than accommodating!

On top of the wonderful hosts, the location was perfect!  It was close to pretty much everything we wanted to do and was literally a 3 minute walk to the nearest public transit (Filmore and Haight)!!!!  We had a blast and staying here was definitely a wise and wonderful decision.  We will not hesitate to stay here again if we ever come back to SF!!!

Thanks for the amazing experience and sharing your home with us!

Kat and Rich Patricks place was quite unique with the furnishings giving the place its own personality. Whilst we did not get to meet Patrick, his cousin Gerlie was available on the day we arrived to show us the place. We were sharing the place with her and another couple at the time although you wouldn't have known as we didnt bump into anyone after we checked in so we had complete privacy. The room itself was small but suited its purpose and was clean throughout. The only thing missing would be a tv but not a big deal since we were out most of the time. Location was fine- took us approx 20-30 min to get to areas around fishermans wharf by bus.  My friend and I had a great time staying at Patrick's home which was spacious and beautifully decorated. He was friendly and accommodating and he gave solid dinner recommendations as well! His place was convenient to transportation, famous sights and delicious restaurants.

The room itself is small but still cozy and clean. The bed was comfortable for two people and the bathroom was stocked with fresh towels and toiletries. The only complaint that I had was that on one of the nights, there was a very loud party going on in the building next to us which made it difficult to unwind and relax from a long day but other than that I would recommend staying here!  Patrick is the perfect host: very easy to communicate with, welcoming and friendly. The flat is in a great location to discover San Francisco. Definitely recommend it and would be happy to stay there again! Patrick's place is spacious and comfortable.  Patrick is a great host! Everything you need is near by. Pharmacy, groceries, great restaurants etc. We highly recommend a stay at Patrick's. It has been a great pleasure to stay at patricks beautiful home. The room was cosy, the house beautifully decorated and well located.  Patrick is an amazing host, very kind,  helpful and supportive in every situation. I enjoyed talking to him and i also loved his sweet dog. I would always come back to patricks home!   Das Zimmer sieht genauso aus wie auf den Fotos! Die Lage ist Top und Patrick ist ein freundlicher und angenehmer Gastgeber. Ich kann das Zimmer mit guten Gewissen weiter empfehlen.

Patrick, thank you for the wonderful days in san francisco!

Nicole & Dax This is our first Airbnb experience and we were very pleased with our choice to stay at Patrick's lovely home. Patrick is a great host and is always happy to chat with us. He is very accommodating and gave us some great tips on places to eat and things to do.
Public transport is very close by and convenient. We did quite a bit of walking to other popular surrounding suburbs/attractions  such as Castro, Mission, Ashbury/Haight, Panhandle and Golden Gate Park.
Patrick's dog Fanny is an extremely well behaved dog, not a sound from her apart from the initial welcome bark. It was also lovely to meet Eric.
We highly recommend Patricks' place.  Patrick was a perfect host and the place was spotless. We would definitely stay there again! Thank you, Patrick! We stayed at patrick for 3 nights - it was wonderfull! On one hand respecting our privacy, and on the other hand offering and delivering all we needed. The bed is very comfortable, the room had everything we needed and the apt and room were very clean. we didnt really used the lovely kitchen who had all that a couple need for a stay. Patrick apt is very hommy, he is a sweet caring person and next time in Sf we will surly come again!
 I loved staying at Patrick's house. The area is really nice, only some blocks to Alamo Sq. in a very beautiful and typical neighborhood. The host is very kind and the room was lovely. Hope to be able to be back soon! I had a perfect stay at Patrick's home in Lower Haight. Although I was barely there during my stay, Patrick was incredibly hospitable, accommodating and his home is impeccable. The room was quiet, comfortable and the inclusion of a private bath make it the perfect place to crash for a few days. Highly recommend Patrick's home to any airbnb traveler.  Patrick's house is gorgeous and he is the perfect host. The room is cozy, the bed very comfortable, and I was amazed at how quiet it was. I definitely recommend it and will stay there again. Patrick's apartment was a great spot to stay in SF! The location was great, many delicious restaurants within walking distance, close to bus lines, and the downtown area. The room was clean and tidy and nicely decorated, as well as quiet. Patrick allowed use of his kitchen which was super helpful. Patrick was a great host; friendly and informative.  Patrick was a gracious, helpful host. His house was very clean and inviting, with an overall great vibe. The room was cozy and nicely decorated and had a private bathroom, which was very convenient. Parking was a little tough, but it's a beautiful, quiet part of town. Would love to stay there again! Patrick has a great apartment and it is very beautifully maintained and well kept. I love the wooden floors and the decor. Given my travel schedule, I had to go back and forth with him multiple times to ensure that we could meet with him and "check in". He was very accommodating. I was surprised at how quiet the neighborhood is in spite of it being in the middle of the city. There are multiple restaurants, bars and places to shop right around the apartment. I would recommend staying here to anyone looking for a comfortable, clean and accessible place to stay in the city.  Delightful place in San Francisco.  the bedroom is immaculate and the apartment is beautiful furnished and decorated.  Patrick is a gracious host always smiling while giving you good information about the city.  I attended a workshop a few blocks away and walking in this quiet neighborhood was very pleasant and nice experience. Patrick is the perfect host and the space is excellent, small but with all the amenities including a private bathroom!  Patrick also accommodated our very last-minute travel plans. Having lived in SF for many years until last year, I can attest to the quality of the location and the great price! Would definitely stay there again. Patrick is a great host, his home is beautifully decorated and clean.  The area is centrally located with easy access to several neighborhoods.  His dog is sweet and quiet.  I would definitely  recommend this room for a single traveler.   Patrick & Erick are perfect hosts. Hospitality - that is what you get if you decide to stay here.
TIP: Patrick's airbnb is in a perfect location and most of the tourist attractions are easy to reach by public transportation. If you decide to rent a car, free parking can be found on the same street.
TRICK:Ask Patrick what needs to happen to have an Oyster & Champagne breakfast and you will not regret it. I couldn't have asked for a better host for my first Airbnb experience!!  Patrick was SO accommodating, friendly, and very helpful.  He provided us with many food and sight seeing suggestions and how to get around town via Muni.  Our room and private bath were clean, comfortable, and just as pictured.  The location is walking distance to several restaurants, bars, parks, etc. and a short bus ride to other tourist spots like Union Square and Fisherman's Wharf.  I would definitely look for Patrick's postings when I visit SF again!  *Bonus: his dog Fanny is quiet, lovable, and super adorable!! Patrick was a gracious host in every respect. His home is beautiful, with art and artifacts from all over the world. The bedroom and private bath were small but comfortable and had everything one could need. I look forward to making this my San Francisco home away from home. Patrick was a great host! He graciously made arrangements to meet me at a different time for my check in, and took the time to show me around his home to make me feel welcome. The room it self is clean and well appointed. The bed is comfortable, and if the cold of San Francisco gets to you at night then Patrick has provide a space heater which works great! The bathroom is also very clean and water pressure and temperature are great. I wouldn't hesitate to stay at Patrick's place again. Patrick and Fanny were perfect hosts! The room was exactly as pictured, clean and tidy. The bed was comfortable, a big plus at the end of a busy day navigating those San Francisco hills. The location was perfect and had easy access to the metro and bus stops. This was a great place for our first Airbnb experience and we can only hope the rest of our adventures are accompanied with this level of hospitality and warmth.  Great host, amazing place, super convenient location! Thanks Patrick for contributing to our unforgettable experience in SF! We have a great time in SF and Patrick's place was a perfect base to do all visiting we wanted. The place has a great location,  is clean and comfortable. Patrick was very friendly and helpful.  I definitely recommend his place. Patrick was the perfect host, knowledgeable, friendly and welcoming with great tips for the local area and the city as a whole.  He was the perfect ambassador for our first Airbnb experience.

The apartment is very comfortable with good links to everywhere in the city.  The neighbourhood is also really well supplied with some trendy bars and eateries and great places for breakfast just around the corner.  Patrick will point you in the right direction!

We were delighted at how peaceful and quiet it was and slept very well.  We'd recommend Patrick's place to anyone looking for a great location in San Francisco.  Great appartment. Great location. And an ever better host. Patrick was kind, helpful and easy going. This was our first experience with Airbnb. We would recommend Patrick's house for sure, we had an unforgettable time. His house is very welcoming, we felt like home. Our Bedroom was clean and confortable, so we slept very well. The neighbourhood is well located and very convenient to visit SF.   The reservation was canceled 48 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. Très bel appartement, calme et spacieux et bien situé (5min de marche du métro qui amène partout). La chambre est confortable mais petite, surtout le lit (grandes gens sachez le !). Grand frigo où vous pouvez déposer vos courses.
Patrick est accueillant.  Patrick has been the host for our first absolute experience with Airbnb. We were referred by friends, and for sure I'll be referring friends to book his rooms. Neighborhood is quite, the room is clean and very well furnished, and Patrick is so kind! we loved stay there :) Patrick was a great host. He has the most beautiful house, and in the evening when we came back from a long day we were greeted by his adorable dog. The room had everything we needed from hairdryer to international plugs. The room is beautifully decorated and it felt like a home. The area is very safe and quiet. We would love to stay there again when we visit the city.  We had a great time at Patrick's place. Everything is clean there. The appartment is beautiful and really close to bus and streetcar stations. Patrick has got a lot of travel guides about San Francisco -- very helpful. It's a quiet place in a good neighbourhood. We could use the kitchen and store our things in the fridge. On our last day Patrick let us store our luggage at his place until we had to leave for the airport. We would love to stay there again. Patrick was a great host! His clear communication style made planning our stay a breeze. Although we got into town earlier than the check-in time, Patrick was nice enough to let us drop off our bags so we could explore the city on our own. And he gave us tons of helpful tips and ideas on where to go.

His place is immaculate, well decorated, cozy, and clean. I would definitely recommend! Apartment and room were absolutely gorgeous. Patrick was courteous, helpful, and a great host. Would definitely stay again. My fiance and I had a wonderful time staying at Patrick's beautiful home during our recent visit to San Francisco. Patrick is a welcoming host who made us feel right at home. This was our first airbnb booking and we're delighted to have had such a great experience! Patrick was a fantastic host and has a beautiful home.  The neighborhood is very cool and centrally located.  This was my first experience with Airbnb and it couldn't have gone any smoother.  Would definitely recommend his place to anyone interested in visiting San Francisco. Great place to stay in a beautiful apartment. Very clean space in a nice neighborhood and close to public transport. Patrick was a great host and a very nice person. I would strongly recommend this place to anyone. Lovely place with a perfect host. Location is excellent to explore the funky places of SF. Patrick was fantastic from check-in to dropping us off at the airport.  Superschöne Location mit einem perfekten Gastgeber, einen Block entfernt vom "Leben"..
Danke für alles Patrick !!! The house was really well connected to downtown with buses which are just 5 minutes walk from Patrick's place. The appartment was very clean and with all amenities.
Patrick was very helpful and responsive. I'd definetly recommend staying at his place. Our stay in Patrick's place was very pleasant, he was very nice, respectful and helpful during our stay. The house as well as the room we stayed were very clean, ordered and well kept. We loved the decoration and the vibe. The place is very well located just a few steps from the bus station and Haight street which has grocery stores, small retail shops and restaurants. From Patrick's place we walked to Haight Ashbury, Golden Gate Park, Alamo Square, Hayes Valley, Civic Center, Castro and Mission districts, so there is a lot of places to go within a walking distance. We would definetly stay again at Patricks place. Patrick was a great host - he provided us with lots of reference material to help us on our trip to San Francisco, and was always willing to answer any questions we had. The room was smaller, but what you would expect from an older house, and we had enough space to maneuver around.

 Patrick was a wonderful host! The bedroom and bathroom were very clean and tastefully decorated. Patrick gave us great restaurant recommendations in the neighborhood. His dog Fanny is super cute! We had a great time in SF and would definitely stay with Patrick again!  Me and my boyfriend stayed at Patrick's place for eight days! Everything was great!!! The place was nice, clean and stylish! Patrick was super nice to us and recommended a bunch of places we visited throughout the week! All the places he recommended were amazing! Patrick also let us use his kitchen and living room space whenever we needed it! I really appreciate it! We were able to cook and enjoy our stay even more!! Patrick also would leave out fresh fruit, coffee and teas for us!
The neighborhood is great! Lots of things to do! The area is safe as well!
Patrick's place was a great choice!!! ;) Patrick consiguió que nos sintiéramos como en casa facilitando todo lo necesario para que así fuera. El barrio tranquilo y sin vagabundos alrededor de la calle, lo cual es bastante típico en san Francisco.repetiría sin ninguna duda.  Our days in Patrick's home were perfect. Good location, good house and great host. Thank you! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Patrick and Fanny (his dog) and highly recommend his Airbnb to anyone thinking of staying in San Francisco.

Patrick was welcoming, kind, generous, informative, organised and responsible. He provided lots of information about San Francisco and travel details. His responses were always quick and courteous.

The apartment is beautiful and clearly well designed and decorated. The room was clean with adequate space and provisions (WiFi, desk, wardrobe and toiletries).

We highly recommend you book with Patrick.  My boyfriend and I had a great stay at Patrick's lovely San Francisco apartment.  The room and bathroom were impeccably clean and we were very comfortable there.  Patrick was welcoming, helpful, and very friendly.  The location of the apartment was great!  Restaurants and bars are well within walking distance.  I would highly recommend his listing to anyone looking for a place to stay in SF! Patrick was a great host, very helpful, polite and sincerely friendly. We loved his place and all his advice about places to visit. Thanks for the coffee in the morning, that was a big plus. My wife and I spent 3 nights in Patrick's nice flat at Page Street in San Francisco. Unfortunately we didn't meet Patrick because he was on holiday. But his cousin gave us the keys and the instructions. Everything worked out fine. The flat is really nice. (we liked the interior) Our bedroom was not that big but for us it was great enough. And the room has also it's own bathroom. Perfect! We would book this room again! We stayed two nights in Patrick's apartment and really enjoyed our time there! The room is small, but because Patrick is an interior designer it is organised perfectly and very tasteful. Everything was very clean and aesthetically pleasing and the bed very comfortable (important to us!) We were also able to use the kitchen which was great (we only used it for breakfasts) and the surrounding area is also very nice,safe and central. We really admired Patrick's house (some inspiration for our own?!) and really felt at home. Fanny is also a lovely dog!  We spent three nights at Patrick's place in September. The apartment is really nice and the location is perfect for exploring the city. Patrick was a very friendly host, allowing us to use the kitchen area, as well as sharing his tea/coffee etc. The room is quite small, but very nicely decorated and clean  and good value considering the location. The only slight negative is that nobody was home when we arrived, despite sharing flight details etc. So we had to wait in the street for 20 mins. Would definitely stay here again. The moment Patrick opened the door, we felt very welcome and at home. Althought small, our bedroom was beautifully decorated, just like the rest of his house. We even had our own bathroom, impeccably clean and with toiletries. The bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows to choose from.
Patrick knows a lot about the best places to visit and to go to for dinner, and provides tons of other useful information (books, brochures, stories).
 His house is in a very pleasant and safe neighborhood, close to bars, shops, public transport and some touristic highlights.
I would definitely recommend his listing to anyone looking for a great place to stay in SF! My boyfriend and I stayed at Patrick's house for two nights.  Our experience was very delightful.  Patrick, his home, and Fanny(cute little morkie) were both very welcoming.  He allowed us to come and go as we please, but kept himself available and willing to give us suggestions and recommendations about the area.  His home is in a great location, and within walking distance of many great San Francisco attractions.  As first time airbnb users, Patrick set a wonderful standard and we hope to stay with him again.  1000 thanks to Patrick, for letting us stay in his lovely home. Great host, nice neighborhood, fast and easy communication!
Sophia & Christoph It's a clean and quite street and safe neighborhood.  The room is quite cozy and I have slept very well.  Thanks a lot to Patrick for his kind help during my stay period. I will definitely choose his room next time.  Patrick was away on vacation during my visit but his cousin Gerlie, was there to welcome me.

It was a smooth process and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.

The description was accurate and the bed was very comfy.  We didn't have the pleasure of enjoying Patrick's company while we stayed at his house since he was on vacation, but his cousin Gerlie was a very kind host. Clear instructions on arrival and we stayed in a very cozy bedroom and clean bathroom, as described in the listing. Patrick's collection of antiques and furniture were one of a kind, and it was very entertaining to just gaze at them while having coffee in the morning. Location-wise, it was almost in the center of all the places we wanted to visit in the city, and the neighborhood was beautiful during the day and safe at night. We wouldn't hesitate to stay there again! Patrick's room was absolutely lovely. We loved everything about it: the bed was amazing, great decorations, perfect private bathroom. The rest of the house was super cool as well, you could easily spend a day admiring all the art and designs. We also loved the neighbourhood. Haight street was bustling with life in restaurants, pubs and cafés. There's a tiny Wholefoods nearby, as well as two mini marts that open till very late. Public transport was also very convenient, you're at Union Square within 10 minutes with either bus or metro.

We didn't get to meet Patrick, but his cousin Gerlie was very bubbly and fun.  Clean, chic and comfortable.  The house had a lot of character.  The bed seemed pretty new.  Easy to get around from this location, although parking spaces are hard to come by.  The room with attached bath was on the small side, but we were out most of the time anyway.  Patrick was away, but he left a few books and maps on San Francisco, even some coupons.  The World Series made the whole town noisy, but couldn't hear much when the door is closed.  Our housemates debriefed us everynight on their outings and vice versa.  All of us decided we'd definitely come back to Patrick's. My boyfriend and I had a wonderful and relaxing time at Patrick's place in Lower Haight.

Patrick and Gerlie were very responsive and accommodating. Gerlie was extremely helpful on the night of our arrival and helped us land a great (and free!) parking spot right near Patrick's house.

The room was clean, quiet and the bed was comfortable.

The location was perfect and we easily walked everywhere, including Haight Ashbury, Golden Gate Park and local restaurants.  We thoroughly enjoyed staying at Patrick's perfectly curated apartment.  Unfortunately, we did not get the opportunity to meet him since he was traveling, However, his cousin, Gerlie, made us feel at home during check in.  The bed was very comfortable and there were plenty of extra bed linens in case we needed them.  There was tea and coffee available to us if desired and we had use of the his very well stocked kitchen for cooking.  The bathroom was very clean and had good water pressure.  The neighborhood was conveniently located and we felt perfectly safe walking around.   My only criticism would be the neighbors who were loud and not very self aware that they were sharing close quarters with others.  Of course, there is only so much that you can do about others' behavior.  Regardless, I would definitely stay at Patrick's again.  Patrick was a great host - he provided us with a warm welcome and had some travel guides and restaurant recommendations prepared.

His place is very clean, comfortable and only one block away from the main tourist attraction - the painted ladies. Generally, the neigbourhood is very quiet and peaceful. The city centre however can be reached easily with public transportation and is nearby, too. Due to the fact that we enjoyed staying at Patricks place really very much, we extended our stay with him for a few more nights. Thank you Patrick, for being such a great host and providing us with a really comfy and clean place. Much appreciated :) The location was so convenient! Easily walkable distance to many great eateries, cafés, shopping, and dancing spots. Patrick was very helpful and Fany was the most adorable dog. Private bath and wifi were a huge plus. Wonderfully decorated (and clean) room and apt - like straight out of a magazine. Do keep in mind the walls are rather thin and wooden floors in the hallway do creak. We are heavy sleepers so it was fine for us, but I can imagine light sleepers having some trouble. I couldn't imagine a better place to stay. An impeccably designed home, clean, spacious, in a great location. And Patrick is the perfect host -- warm, inviting and personable. I would stay there again in a heartbeat. My girlfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Patrick's beautiful home. He was so welcoming and gave us some excellent restaurant recommendations. We loved the room (the bed was so comfortable!) and it's super convenient location- a short walk or bus ride away from most every attraction we visited.  We highly recommend staying here and would love to visit again! Patricks  place was awesome! he was very helpful with eveything and very nice. the location was great, too! We had a great time at Patrick's gorgeous home. The location is wonderful, so close to transport and easily walk-able to so many iconic San Francisco places.  The room is really comfortable, with lots of little touches that make it feel homely.
Patrick was really helpful, providing plenty of great tips and really accommodating with our not so easy luggage.
We loved our stay here and would be happy to do so again. Patrick's space was GREAT! He's a welcoming host and made us feel right at home. The room we rented featured a comfy bed and it's own bathroom which was an added bonus. The house in general is a beautifully designed space with lots of light and very comfortable furnishings. Patrick gave us full access to the kitchen and living areas and provided us with coffee and tea every morning which is a gracious treat.
The neighborhood is really cool and features a lot of restaurants, bars, and boutiques all within a block of the home. It's also located close to multiple Muni lines so getting around the city is very easy.
The only negative experience we had was being able to hear the neighbors at night. I can't fault Patrick, but still think it should be noted if you consider yourself a light sleeper.

Overall, I recommend the space and would likely rent again when in SF.  I stayed at Patricks for 6 nights and slept like a baby! The bed was amazingly comfortable. The house is situated perfectly for those who want to explore San Francisco by public transport. Very nice neighbourhood. Being my first AirBNB experience, I didn't exactly know what to expect, but Patrick was a great host. He gave me some really good tips on arts and culture in San Francisco and I was even invated to a Oscar-Party he threw. Watching the Academy Awards with his friends was surely one of the highlights from my stay in San Francisco. Patrick was kind, warm, welcoming, and accommodating! He even found a blow dryer for me to use last-minute. :) Communication was great. I loved the coffee/tea/hot chocolate "bar" in the kitchen. The space is clean, beautiful, and in a perfect location--close to restaurants, bars, parks, and the painted ladies. I took Ubers to my conference in the financial district and it was a breeze and cheap. I would highly recommend staying with Patrick! Staying at Patrick's place was great.
The appartment is really nice (and very well decorated). The room (with its own bathroom) was clean and pretty convenient.
Even if the room was a bit small, it was perfect for our stay and I guess that nobody needs a bigger room while visiting SF and spending post of the time outside. The bed was good.
Moreover, a lot of small attention was placed in the room by Patrick: phone charger, power adapter, city map etc...

Patrick was really nice with us and was able to arrange himself to take us to the airport.

We definitely recommend to stay at Patrick's place and will probably stay there again for a future trip to SF.
 Patrick was an exceptional host. He was warm, friendly, and shared excellent recommendations for activities around the neighborhood and city. The room was very comfortable - especially the bed - and was exactly as advertised. The neighborhood was perfect for our stay - lots of nearby restaurants, bars, parks, etc. and very convenient to get almost anywhere in the city. I would definitely stay here again! Patrick was a wonderful host. Because his family had to stay with him on short notice, he offered us to stay in his studio (in the same house), which turned out to be even better than we could have hoped. Patrick's place has the perfect location in the city, really cool area with many awesome restaurants in walking distance and it's easy to get everywhere in SF. We didn't need to use our car at all in the 5 days we were there. The studio was a beautiful, clean and comfortable space and we absolutely loved it. Patrick was incredibly nice and always available whenever we had questions. We would definitely stay with him again. Highly recommended! We spent 4 nights at Patrick's. Even though we arrived very late at night Patrick welcomed us. The room and bathroom where spot on and Patrick gave us very helpful information about the area and san francisco including a city map which helped a lot. Besides this patrick just is a very friendly and easy going guy. We can definitely recommend staying at his. Patrick communicated clearly about arranging our arrival time. Check in was quite simple with him giving us an overview of visitor information about San Fran, making maps and books available to use freely, his key/lock situation was super simple, and the room was exactly as described. Patrick takes great care in his interior space, his belongings and makes you feel quite at home in his home. He has fruit and hot drinks available as needed.  Patrick's place stood out from his photos, and it was fantastic in person. You really can't go wrong with so many positive reviews and I think there's very little I can add. Excellent communication from start to finish and Patrick was a most welcoming and considerate host. We had a great time, and the area is very convenient to get around with an easy walk to many places and attractions. Parking was a little difficult, so it's just something to bear in mind if you're driving. Highly recommended! Perfect quiet apartment in a very nice and peaceful neighborhood. Patrick is a polite and helpful host - we felt in good hands!!!  We loved Patrick's place! It was very clean, quiet and well decorated. The neighborhood was perfect, with lots to do around the area, and it was located very close to public transportation for when we ventured out further. Patrick was a great host, very welcoming and accommodating. He gave us a rundown of the neighborhoods, things to do, places to eat, etc. We were very happy with our stay! Patrick was a great host! Friendly and helpful! The room was small for but works for a couple of nights. Really comfy bed. All clean and fresh! Great neighborhood.  The host canceled this reservation 79 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. Patrick was a lovely host, making us feel welcome and being very willing to share his knowledge of the local area. Everything was provided, which made this stay no-fuss...exactly how I like it :)

The apartment was spacious and located one street over from Haight, which made it really convenient for reaching shops, cafes etc. It was definitely a good choice for our stay! Patrick war ein sehr freundlicher Gastgeber. Er war zuvorkommend und hat uns tolle Tipps für San Fracisco gegeben.
Das Zimmer war klein aber sehr schön und gepflegt. Wir fühlten uns wohl und können Patrick jedem weiterempfehlen. Patrick was very friendly and his house is very tastefully decorated. He made us feel very welcome and was a terrific help explaining how to use public transport to go sightseeing in San Francisco. We loved his dog Fanny and felt very safe whilst we stayed with Patrick. There are some great inexpensive restaurants closeby and we enjoyed not only Patrick's company but also the other guests who were staying there during our visit. Patrick drove us to the airport when we left and we really appreciated all that he did for us throughout our stay. He is a great person to have as a host and we would both recommend Patricks house to fellow travellers. Patrick was great. He was very communicative when I texted or messaged him on AirBnB. His dog is super cute! The interior of the house is beautiful.

I was in the room with a bathroom, and the space was a lot smaller than I expected, but it was still comfortable.

This was a shared space, but I barely noticed the other guests in the house. However, the walls/windows between buildings are pretty thin so you may hear neighbors outside if they are having a party.

The location was also awesome. It's a quick walk to a really cool area in SF called Hayes Valley where there are a lot of restaurants, shops and other things to do.
 Patrick's apartment is really lovely and in a cool area of San Fran with plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance.  Public transport is also good and reliable so no need to drive anywhere.  The room and bathroom were very clean and homely but on the small side if space is what you are after. Also beware of parking which can get very busy so you may have to drive around in find a space.  All in all a very pleasant experience and although we didn't meet Patrick he was very helpful and responsive to any enquiries. Simply put, Patrick was amazing.  We stayed 4 nights in the room with a bathroom.  It suited our needs very well.  Patrick's apartment is beautifully decorated with thought put into every little detail.  Whenever we needed recommendations, Patrick was happy to help.  His place is also in a very convenient location which allowed us easy access to transit and to many cool parts of San Francisco.

Fanny is also the best.  It was a pleasure to stay at Patrick's beautiful, artfully curated apartment. The location is great for the Number 7 bus, within walking distance of the lively Castro and Mission districts, but on a quiet, peaceful street.

Our room was a little noisy at night one night, due to a Warriors win and celebrating neighbours! But it was nothing that earplugs didn't fix, and there was little noise on the other nights.

Patrick made us feel welcome and gave us access to his kitchen amenities, had laid out coffee and tea for us. It was nice to have our own bathroom. He also has a gorgeous and friendly little dog that we loved to hang out with. We thoroughly recommend him and this room.  Patrick was very sweet. His home was much better than the photos. He was able to accommodate us on the very last minute and we were very grateful. Fanny, his little dog was adorable! The decor beautiful and in good taste (he is a design consultant and a world traveler and it shows in his decor). The location is great and close to shopping and the Mission District, which we LOVE for great eats. We were very happy! Patrick is a phenomenal host. He reached out well in advance to make sure he'd be able to greet my friend and I upon our arrival. Even though I had to change arrival time a couple times, Patrick was still very genuine and understanding. Once we arrived, he took the time to explain where the best areas were, how to get around, and every restaurant he recommended was just great. His home is so calming and warm. I actually had been having trouble sleeping for several nights but slept comfortably my entire stay here. The room was perfect, equipped with clean fresh sheets and towels. Far better than a hotel experience in my opinion. And the location could not have been more perfect for our travel plans.  Patrick made us feel at home. He gave us some tips about San Francisco which were really useful. The room was exactly as shown in the picture and everything was perfect and very clean. As for the neighborhood, it was in a central location, very close from Castro and Mission, but very quiet at the same time.
I would recommend Patrick´s apartment to have a great stay in SF!
 Patrick was super, very accommodating and welcoming. He had tour  books, maps and lots of advice. Home was very clean and comfy. The location was great in a quiet neighborhood. It is a hefty walk up the stairs to the unit. The bedroom is small but very adequate.  Private attached bath was nice.  This is a very clean, quiet and convenient place to stay. Patrick is a friendly host and offered good suggestions to visit different areas of the city.   We have spent two wonderful days in san francisco. Patrick was a great host and my daughter had a great pleasure to play with his nice small dog. thomas Patrick was a great host and the space was perfect. It is in a great SF location close to everything. We had a great time and would come back the next time we are in SF.  Great house/room for a visit to San Francisco. Patrick is a great host, friendly and with lots of advice about the neighbourhood and what to do in the city. We had a great stay!  Patrick was a great host and provided us with lots of tips for nice places to go. We really liked how well everything was organized. We enjoyed our stay at his place.   We had a great stay.  Lower Haight is a great location and Patrick's place provides a cosy little base. Public transport is close to either go into town or to golden gate park and mission cafes and restaurants and Hayes st shops are within walking distance.  Patrick was easy to deal with, was really helpful in providing whatever info we needed and was accommodating in allowing us to leave our bags after check out.  Fanny (dog) was a cute little companion during our stay. Thanks very much for having us Patrick!! Patrick hat uns sehr nett empfangen und uns viele Informationen über San Francisco und im Speziellen über seine Nachbarschaft gegeben. Das Zimmer war sauber und gemütlich, aber da meine Freundin und ich zwei Koffer hatten, wurde es doch etwas eng. Trotzdem haben wir uns in Patricks Wohnung sehr wohl gefühlt, da er auch versucht hat den Aufenthalt möglichst angenehm für uns zu gestalten. Vielen Dank! Patrick was a great host! He was easy to communicate with and provided a lot of information about the bay area. The house is at a great location and the room was very nice and clean. I'll definitely come back to SF again and would love to stay at Patrick's place the next time. We really enjoyed our stay at Patrick's home! It was comfortable and quiet and also located in a great area. There's shopping, transportation and terrific restaurants nearby. Loved walking through the peninsula, which is just a short trip on foot. Patrick had great recommendations and was a terrific host.  Very welcome! Lovely place and good location, Patrick gave us lot of tips and travel cards to get around the city. We loved staying here!

We forgot something at his places and Patrick happily posted this back to us! Thank you! Patrick is a wonderful and kind host. Patrick è gentilissimo ed organizzatissimo! Appena arrivati era lì ad attenderci ed è stato molto amichevole nonostante il nostro ritardo di un giorno! La casa è molto bella, pulitissima e in una posizione comoda per muoversi con i mezzi, noi abbiamo utilizzato molto spesso Uber che da dove si trova Patrick costa molto poco in quanto è considerata una "Smart street". La camera e il bagno erano pulitissimi, e addirittura all'interno abbiamo trovato due adattatori per le prese di corrente. Quindi tranquilli, Con Patrick andrete sul sicuro ! Very welconing host and a very lovely home.
Provided lots of useful information and listing was exactly as described and exactly what we needed.
Very clean home and in a great area of san francisco with excellent transport links

Very impressed especially as first tome using air bnb!! Patrick was a wonderful host! He was very kind and helpful. He gave us all the information we needed about his home, the surrounding area and San Francisco. His apartment was lovely, clean and in a good location to access the places we wanted to visit. I would definitely recommend staying at his place! Julia It was really great staying at Patrick's home. He lives in a nice neighbourhood with nice restaurants and bars. It is also close to public transport.
Patrick welcomed us very friendly. The room looks exactly as on the pictures. It was very nice and clean but also a little bit small.
We can highly recommend staying at Patrick's home. :) Loved Patrick’s interior design, he is a very easy-going, helpful and friendly host. Great location. Highly recommend it =) The accommodation is in a great location with lots of public transport nearby. The neighbourhood of Lower Haight is friendly with bars, restaurants and shops nearby which had a nice local feel. The room itself is as described, we were particularly impressed with the decor and cleanliness. Patrick was a welcoming and helpful host recommending nearby restaurants and general tours and amenities. This was our first experience of Airbnb and we were thoroughly impressed.  Patrick met us in person and had a "travel" section in his house with maps and booklets about San Fran.  The property was close to all the major transport lines and very convenient to get to the major attractions.  The room was amazing and we were very comfortable during our stay.
  The room was clean & well kept. It is a bit smaller but cozy enough for 2 people. We did not meet Patrick but communication was clear & good. The home is decorated nicely. We took the muni to get around and the bus stops are within a few minutes walking distance. The home is located on a quiet street. Overall enjoyed our stay & would recommend! Great spot in the city.  Beautiful home and the room was just right for staying overnight.  If you are someone who needs more space, ask for the larger bedroom with the shared bath if it is available.   I really loved staying with Patrick and his reaallly adorable pup, Fanny. Patrick is super welcoming and his home is so well-decorated and cozy. The location is also great, It's just steps from the Hayes Valley (lots of great shops and eatery) and just a 15-min Uber ride to all the other major spots in San Fran. Patrick has been very helpful the moment I arrived, and his home is blossoming with good vibes :) Definitely recommend!  Patrick was a great host! The room is cozy with great decor and his lovely home is in a great spot in the city. Multiple public transit options are all within just a few blocks so you'll have an easy time getting around the city. And Patrick has plenty of great recommendations on local restaurants and spots to see! Patrick is a tremendously gracious and welcoming host.  He made my first Airbnb stay a wonderfully positive experience.  His home is beautiful, the room very comfortable, and just as pictured.  Having an ensuite bathroom adjacent to the bedroom makes this place perfect for a solo traveller.  The house is ideally situated to transit, in a neighbourhood full of interesting restaurants and shops.  The lower Haight is a cool part of town central to everything.   I would most certainly stay with Patrick again on my next trip.  Everything about my stay was exceptional.

 Patrick is a very gracious host. He welcomed us warmly and was very willing to offer us information about San Francisco and the neighborhood. He has lots of tour information available for his guests- such as maps, pamphlets and magazines.   His home is on a quiet street and we were comfortable walking in the neighborhood after dark.  Patrick was very accommodating and  flexible. We arrived later than anticipated, and he was more than understanding. He had brochures and public transit cards available to us as well as maps and breakfast beverages for the morning. The space was true to the listing.  We had a lovely stay in tranquil lower haight. The location is very convenient! We stayed in SF for a week and were delighted with Patrick's apartment. It was in a lovely neighbourhood with easy transport links to all the good places. The apartment itself is beautiful -- you can really tell that Patrick has put a lot of love and thought into every little detail. Patrick is extremely friendly and made us feel very welcome, we very much enjoyed our chat at the end of our stay. We would stay again and highly recommend!! Lovely apartment in a great location! Patrick was the warmest host, very welcoming and helpful.  Patrick's been very welcoming and helpful in hosting us. It's my first time to tour the San Francisco city, and Patrick has maps and touring guides ready at the place. He also helped by giving advice on finding good places to eat and places to rent a car.
The kitchen appliances are more than enough. There's grounded coffee for use for free, and food bars.
There is no central heating so the house is bit cold in December, but Patrick has provided a electric heater in the room. The room is a bit small for two and it's a bit hard to find a power socket to charge your phone, but the good thing is it comes with a private bathroom.  Patrick was very welcoming and kind.  He has a very nice home in a great area of San Fran! Patrick was a great host & his home is beautiful.
From booking to arrival to check out, Patrick was very responsive, welcoming and helpful. I was staying there for business meetings as well as some personal relaxation where he offered maps, ideas on places to eat and visit.
The room was exactly as pictured, very clean and had everything I needed. It felt like home!
I hope to stay again when back in town for my next trip. I definitely recommend this space for people passing through and wanting a comfortable and convenient place to stay while touring the city.  Patrick was the ultimate host -- welcoming & kind, and he offered us plenty of information/tips/small items to make our visit the best it could be! Also, as a dog lover, it was so wonderful to stay with Fanny :) We would reccomend this spot to any of our friends, or friends of friends, looking for a great, centrally located place to stay.  Patrick was a gracious host.  He was very helpful in advising where to find things.   Patrick was a courteous host, and I'll likely be planning another stay at this location! The private bath, with all the accoutrements was a huge benefit. Thanks Patrick! Patrick was very welcoming and considerate. He gave me very helpful advices about places to visit and how to get there.
The room was as described, clean and comfortable. Although Patrick was out of town during my stay, he arranged for his cousin to meet us with keys and answer all of our questions. His home was tranquil, indeed; and decorated beautifully. Our bed was extremely comfortable and we very much enjoyed our first Airbnb experience here. Patrick's home was located in a great neighborhood with a short walking distance to restaurants, shops and nightlife. Another great stay! Everything in its place, clean, and again the private bathroom is clutch! Patrick was a very gracious host. He welcomed into his place with warmth and kindness and offered us several useful recommendations for dining and sightseeing options. He also has an adorable (and quiet / well-behaved) dog!

As for the apartment, it was perfect. Very quiet, convenient location in a pretty neighborhood. Walking distance to a lot of shops and restaurants. The room itself is small (we were two) and might be a tight squeeze if two guests aren't very close. Otherwise, the room was as described, very clean and private.  One of the nicest Airbnb's I've ever stay at!

Patrick was a wonderful host. For those not familiar with the city he has plenty of guidebooks available and is a great person to chat with.

The room, along with the rest of the apartment, was beautiful, clean, and quiet. The neighborhood is safe, clean, and is just a few blocks away from major transit lines and tons of great food.

I definitely want to stay here again. Thanks again for everything, Patrick. Patrick was a great host during our stay at SF. The interior of his house was great and an absolute beauty to take in and also had subtle features which were great (I refer to the multi power adapter placed in a simple box in our room! Really needed it). The location allowed my wife and I to travel around the city with ease and affordability. Overall, thank you Patrick for a lovely stay! Patrick was a great host.  He was away while we were in San Francisco, but his cousin Gerlie met us to give us our keys.  She was waiting for us outside as our Uber pulled up.  She was very friendly and showed us around the place.  The room is accurate to the description and pictures.  The bed is very comfy and the bathroom was clean and worked well.  Patrick had lots of ideas and tips on things to do in San Francisco.  The neighborhood is very well located in relation to the different things to do in San Francisco.  There are also many great restaurants nearby and it is in walking distance of many attractions.  I would definitely recommend staying here for your San Francisco visit.   Patrick was very welcoming and helpful.  Good interaction prior to arriving and day of.  Room was as described and the apartment is beautiful with gorgeous plants and great artifacts from around the world.  Highly recommended for the location, ambience and price. Patrick was a great host and made us feel welcome. The room was clean and tidy and the apartment is ideally located on a quiet street with plenty of cafes and restaurants a short walk away. Highly recommended! This was our first experience with airbnb and we have to admit Patrick set a very high bar for future visits.  I have come to San Francisco for conferences many times and this experience was very different.  Living in a neighborhood with a gracious host changed our experience of San Francisco and gave us a different appreciation for the city.

Staying with Patrick was like visiting an old friend in a new city.   Patrick is a very outgoing and friendly and from the moment we arrived he was gracious and very helpful during our visit.  He showed us his house which was beautiful.  The home is an older one with the original woodwork in the living room and dining room.  Coupled with Patrick's artistic decorating skills, the home has a very unique and distinctive charm.  The kitchen is very modern and available to guests.  We were able to eat breakfast there each morning and store food in the refrigerator.  There were things like tea, coffee snacks, fruit, eggs, and cereal available for our use.  There is a local whole foods grocery store and a CVS pharmacy just a block away .  Our room with adjoining bathroom was nice and the bed was comfortable.  The bathroom was modern and very clean.  Patrick had a lot of information both in the room and kitchen for things to do around the city during our stay.  The neighborhood is very quiet and clean and the houses are well kept.  Buses are available to go downtown or over to fisherman's wharf.  Trips are 2.25 for 2.5 hours of travel.  We moved around the city either by bus or walking with no problems.  To get to his place from the airport we used the BART and #7 bus and took about an hour and cost about $10 per person.

The most interesting thing about our stay was Patrick's knowledge of the city and tips on things to do during our stay.  He was our personal tour guide.  Haight Street which is a block away is filled with really good restaurants.  In the five days we stayed there, we didn't have a bad meal.  We had wonderful Thai, Indian, and Mexican cuisine.  For the more adventurous, you can walk or take a bus over to the Mission area with great French and Italian food.

Patrick was very accommodating  with our schedule.  He let us store our luggage at his place on our last day so we could do more sightseeing before heading to the airport.

We would highly recommend Patrick's place.  We would definitely stay there again and hope that our future stays with airbnb are as wonderful and interesting as this one.

Thank you Patrick for being such a great host. Patrick was really welcoming ! He knows how to welcome people he has a special desk for information and snacks. The place was Nice.
The one thing under the rest was the bed a little too small for 2. Les contacts avec Patrick se sont bien déroulé. A notre arrivée nous avons eu un petit briefing sur les choses à voir, les moyens de transport et le supermarché à deux pas. Des guides et cartes ont été mis à notre disposition ce que nous avons trouvé très pratique
La chambre, bien que petite, est au calme et agréable dans un bel appartement
il est très bien situé pour découvrir San Francisco, dans un quartier calme et tranquille mais proche des transports et des principaux lieux touristiques à pied It was a perfect place to stay! Very nice neighborhood, just few mins from Alamo Square and few blocks from the Wholefoods and Safe way. The room was very clean and comfortable, it had everything we needed. Patrick was very helpful and polite. We enjoyed out stay very much. Thank you Patrick provides such a warm, and smooth, host experience. I couldn't be more thrilled to have met him, as he's clearly one of the people who form the backbone of AirBnBs strong community, and growth, in the Bay Area.

Strongly recommend! What an amazing experience! Patrick's place felt both luxurious and homely at the same time. Great spot for exploring the city and Patrick gave us some great tips on what to see and how to use the public transport. The apartment was beautiful and Patrick is a lovely, warm host. Would definitely love to return! Thanks so much for having us :) Ik had een prettig verblijf bij Patrick. Hij was een prettige gastheer en de kamer was zeer netjes en schoon. Ik kon prettig mijn eigen gang gaan, maar wanneer ik hem nodig had kon ik hem makkelijk bereiken. Hij had goede tips en veel informatie in zijn huis over SF Patrick is really a great host. His beautyful flat, central located close to Haight Ashbury and Painted Ladies, was our second home during our stay in San Francisco. The warm welcome, the given informations and all the answers to our questions - perfectly!
The room and the private bathroom were well equiped, modern and stylish decorated. We could use all the items in the kitchen to prepare our meals. Besides Patrick offers all essentials (coffee, tea, milk...) for his guests.
We would chose Patrick again to be our host in San Francisco. Patrick was very accomodating when my flight was late - staying up to let me in. The room was really nicely set up with everything I needed and the private bathroom was great. Patrick was a great host and I'd definitely stay again! We stayed with Patrick for 5 nights and the apartment was just as advertised. The room was lovely and very clean, although on the smallish side. However, having our own bathroom made up for this. The rest of the apartment was very nice and spotlessly clean. The location was just perfect, in walking distance of the tram to central San Francisco and close to some amazing bars / restaurants. Would definitely recommend staying here and we would visit again without any hesitation. Jen.  Patrick was an extremely accommodating host, my partner and I visited for 4 nights, and were made to feel nothing but welcome. His apartment was beautiful, the room and private bathroom were just wonderful, and he was happy to allow access to the rest of the apartment (including the kitchen) if needed. He was always interested in how we were enjoying SF, but was never intrusive or over-whelming, happy to provide recommendations to fantastic local restaurants.
I travel to SF regularly for business, and would not hesitate to stay with Patrick again if I extend another trip, I felt very at home there and really was made to feel like I lived in the area for a couple of days. Couldn't recommend him highly enough! Patrick was very welcoming.Explained everything as required.
The room was as described.Good to have private bathroom.
Neighboured pretty good lots of bars & restaurants.
Would definitely stay there again. Patrick's place was beautiful, clean and in a great location; I would definitely recommend it.  Patricks place was perfect for our stay in San Francisco. Just as described - clean, tidy & quiet. Close to transport and plenty of amazing restaurants to choose from just around the corner.
We didn't actually meet Patrick as he was away travelling, however communication was great at all times. His cousin Girlie was at the house to meet us as previously advised - she was fantastic and made us feel very welcome. Would recommend staying at Patricks. We had such a wonderful time staying in Patrick's apartment. The place was so beautiful and full of fascinating objects. It was spotlessly clean and we had everything we needed, including milk, coffee, tea, towels, phone charger, etc.

The neighbourhood is really interesting - a great SF cultural experience! There are lots of restaurants and shops one block away, and we were impressed with how convenient the public transport system was.
While we did't get to meet Patrick as he was away travelling, his cousin let us at the apartment and made us feel welcome. We got some great travel tips!
We are so grateful to have stayed in this wonderful place, it helped us to love our first stay in San Francisco. Would definitely recommend to anyone.   Great apartment! Amazing location, clean  and everything was perfect. I love my stay at Patrick's place! He's a very caring host and made sure that my check-in was as smooth as possible. The room is clean and cozy and has everything that you need. I especially loved the little phone charger box--it saved my life because my charging cable was broken. The neighborhood is mostly quiet, close to nice cafes and restaurants, close to the Golden Gate Park and Buena Vista Park. I would definitely stay at Patrick's place again the next time I'm in SF. I booked Patrick's place for a potential hire who was visiting for a week long trial at our company. Patrick was very responsive and proactive in making sure that our new hire's arrival happened smoothly. Our new hire told me that Patrick's place was lovely and in a great neighborhood. I would highly recommend staying at Patrick's place. This is a good location to visit lower Haight area. Center of the town and easily accessible by muni and walking. It was a quite neighborhood and safe.

Patrick is a very good host. I left something behind on checking out and he is accommodating my request to get it back to me. We had a very nice stay at Patrick's. The house is in a nice and quiet neighbourhood which is still quite central with coffee shops, restaurants etc just around the corner. Patrick's apartment was quite amazing, with beautiful plants and a great buddhism-ispired atmosphere. The room itself was just what we needed, a quiet little space for ourselves in a great city. Patrick was very helpful about suggesting places to go to and giving useful tips. All in all, I would gladly come back and would definitely recommend Patrick's place Lovely and welcoming. Very knowledgable about the area, which was very helpful on our stay in San Francisco. Thoroughly enjoyed our time. Ps. Benny (dog) is the best  Excellent stay in this cozy ensuite in Haight. Patrick our host was responsive, helpful and welcoming. A lovely vibrant neighbourhood as well with great restaurants and drinking spots.  Very nice home, good location for public transport though a little out of town if you only want to walk everywhere. Great guy, helpful with San Fran guides and recommendations for restaurants etc. Included everything we needed and private bath ideal. Thanks Staying with Patrick was a pleasure. Clean, respectful, humble, warm, but leaving me to do my thing. Bed was firm, internet good, bathroom as much as I needed, little table to work at. Great neighbourhood for all types of food and quick groceries. La maison de Patrick est très bien située dans le quartier de Haight street (non loin des fameuses painted ladies). Très bien desservie pour visiter SF.
Nous avions la chambre avec SdB privative. Bien qu'un peu petite, tout était propre et fonctionnel.
La décoration des "pièces communes" fait penser à un cabinet de curiosité.

D'autres personnes en Airbnb louaient une autre chambre sur place mais nous ne les avons pas croisé.

Logement Airbnb à conseiller sans hésitation. We loved our stay at Patrick's. Perfectly situated, beautifully decorated and comfortable. We would definitely come back again.  Special thanks to Gerlie for the warm welcome :) Patrick is a friendly and gracious host. We were made to feel most welcome. Lower Haight is a great neighbourhood with very easy links to downtown. We would definitely stay here again. Patrick's place was warm and lovely, it truly felt like home to us. Easy check-in, clean, clear instructions, and I loved the fact that we took our shoes off before going in.
Thank you!!  O apartamento é como apresentado nas fotos. O quarto é pequeno, não tem muito espaço para malas, mas tem um móvel com gavetas e um pequeno espaço pra pendurar roupas. A casa estava muito limpa. Nosso único problema foi com o chuveiro que não conseguimos fazer funcionar. O pino que regula a saída de água da banheira aparentemente estava estragado, não conseguimos levantá-lo pra usar o chuveiro e acabamos tomando banho no banheiro compartilhado. Patrick não estava em casa durante nossa estadia, mas o primo dele nos recebeu muito bem. Contudo, ele não permaneceu no apartamento e não respondeu meu e-mail sobre o problema no chuveiro. O bairro não é turístico, mas possui vários restaurantes bons e mercadinhos muito próximos ao apartamento. Também há uma parada de ônibus muito próxima que leva para o centro. Ficaria lá de novo, mas não no verão, pois é muito quente e não tem ar-condicionado. Patrick was great! He was a very welcoming host, and made sure to check in with me regularly to make sure I got into his place smoothly for checkin. The whole house is lovely, and the room was exactly what I needed as a quiet retreat to come back to after long, hectic days of running around at a business conference. The bed was super comfy, the room was neat and tidy, and it had cute accents to make it feel homey. Would definitely recommend this place and Patrick as a host! The room is exactly as pictured.  It's clean, cozy, and peaceful.  The bed is comfortable and I slept well each night.  Patrick is an excellent host!  He provided me with a map of bus and train routes in addition to recommendations for restaurants and things to do in the city.  He is very friendly and welcoming! Patrick ist ein sehr angenehmer Gastgeber, das Zimmer ist nicht groß, aber geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Die Wohnung liegt sehr gut, um in den Viertel Lower Haigt und Hayes Valley auszugehen. Es ist auf jeden Fall ein Tipp, San Francisco von dieser Seite kennenzulernen. Patrick ist sehr hilfsbereit und jederzeit ansprechbar für Fragen. Patrick's place was an amazing stay. I was there for 2 weeks on business and Patrick was a great host. His home was immaculate and well designed. You can tell that Patrick takes pride in his home. Because I was there for 2 weeks Patrick even changed my linens and towels which was a nice touch. Patrick made me feel very comfortable and we even enjoyed a glass of wine together one night. The home is centrally located to everything. I would be happy to stay again and recommend Patrick's place to any guest.  Patrick is a wonderful host and the room is perfect and comfortable. The location is a great base for exploring Lower Haight, Hayes Valley, etc. with tons of good restaurants and shops nearby. Communication was very easy and Patrick made sure everything was explained or easy to find or clearly labeled. I would love to stay here again! Beautiful apartment, very nice bedroom also with my own bathroom. I never had the need to use the kitchen and only once ate my dinner in the flat, but it is so comfortable and peaceful I would certainly have welcomed the time to do so. I have recommended to my work colleagues and will return myself in the future

James   A comfortable and stylish apartment in one of my favorite neighborhoods in the city. Great host, great stay. Highly recommended.  This was my first Airbnb and I was a bit nervous when I started reading reviews of other hosts, so I made sure to pick one that had pretty much only positive reviews. It was great. Patrick was very helpful and even leant me an umbrella when it was raining. I left a notebook and he quickly texted me and let me know. The house was warm and quirky at the same time. Definitely recommend.  Patrick's place was wonderful - easy to get to, close to transport, walkable to some interesting districts and close to the Golden Gate Park. Patrick was super helpful and accommodating for our checkin and gave us lots of good recommendations for the city. We would highly recommend staying here :) really comfortable and cozy Patrick's place suited me perfectly.

From meeting me on arrival till I departed he was there to provide information and local knowledge.

Restaurants close by and easy commute into town.

Very comfortable,tastefully decorated apartment.

Nice hesitation in recommending Patrick.



 The perfect weekend getaway. Everything within walking distance, super clean, super friendly host. And just a great all round experience.

10/10. A lovely home for a lovely person - our stay exceeded our expectations. It is a wonderful feeling to know you have a comfortable place to return to after a long day exploring. Clean, hip, and accommodating are a few more words I would use to describe Patrick's place. It is very centrally located with many delicious restaurants, convenience stores, and public transit within walking distance. We had no trouble at all getting around the city without a car. Patrick gave us many top notch recommendations for touring and eating. There is no question that he knows the city well. The room was neat and included all that you will really need, including a killer bed I clocked out on within minutes it was so comfortable. All in all magnificent stay, would highly recommend for solos or couples on a short visit to experience San Fran! It was just perfect. Clean and really charming. Near Castro and Haight. Absolutly again.  Beautiful apartment, and very clean. Would highly recommend and stay again! Patrick is a gracious host! He met us early in the morning after our flight to let us check in and get settled before we headed out for the day. His home is beautiful, calm, and comfortable. It's actually strange that such a tranquil space could exist in such bustling and thriving part of the city.  Patrick's home was beautiful and in a great location. We were able to walk almost everywhere from the house. Everything was very clean and comfortable. Patrick was a wonderful host and very easy to get in contact with. He also gave Us many great suggestions for around the area and gave us maps to show us around. If we are in SF again we will definitely want to stay at Patrick's place!  Patrick's place is excellent and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. We were spending a few days in the city to visit the cultural sites, bars and restaurants and Patrick was always more than happy to help with tips and recommendations. The room itself was as described - very clean and all amenities provided, with nice extra touches like a phone charger, guidebooks and fruit. Patrick's place itself is also very unique, making it a wonderful experience just to stay in the apartment. The location is also great for nightlife etc. Walking distance to Haight Ashbury and short uber rides to the main attractions around the city. Would highly recommend. The place was everything it promised to be: clean, comfortable, convenient, and Patrick was extremely welcoming. We had a fabulous stay and can't wait to come back. Would recommend Patrick's place to everyone  Patrick's home is beautiful and clean, and the street below is quiet. We enjoyed our stay for the weekend and were close to many great restaurants and bars. We would definitely stay again! We did not get to meet Patrick, but he communicated very efficiently and his cousin, Gerlie was very easy to contact- she checked us in with no problem.  Fantastic location, nice, cozy room with private bathroom. Lovely apartment and it was nice to make coffee and have a small breakfast in the kitchen in the mornings. We had a great stay at Patrick's place. The decor is beautiful and we had everything we needed. It was great to have a fully equipped kitchen. This room is smaller than the other room available in the apartment, so if you are traveling with large suitcases I would suggest to book the other room. The location was great and we loved the neighborhood. It was also very quiet. I highly recommend! The room is a little bit small but very clean and lovely. And the host is friendly and helpful. Well located place and many good places to eat in the neighborhood. ;) We stayed 3 nights at Patricks airbnb. For two persons the room was a little too small when you're staying more days. This counts for the bathroom as well. The shower needed some instructions before we could use it.
Unfortunately we didn't met Patrick himself but his cousin Gerlie showed us around the house. The location is great with a few nice restaurants around the corner and the park nearby.
For a night this is nice place to stay.  Patrick's place was great - beautiful, had everything I needed and was very clean.

Great location - close to lots of cafes, restaurants and bars and close to transport options to get around. We really enjoyed our stay in San Francisco at Patrick's. We loved the location, although a long walk/bus to many of the attractions the apartment is in a great neighbourhood and close to many good places to eat and drink. It gave a better idea of what it might be like to live in the city. Patrick was very welcoming and always contactable during our stay. Patrick is very friendly and helpful, and his lovely house is in a great location. Thanks for having us Patrick. Excelente apartamento, tiene todo, impecable y ademas bien ubicado...Patrick siempre pendiente, lo recomiendo mucho One of the most comfortable and relaxing stays I have had. Check-In was seamless and the home has great energy. I loved the location and the comfortable bed. :) Having Gerlie as a host was an added bonus. I will definitely be back.  I had an amazing time! Everything was like expected. The best thing was the communication!! Loved it, I'll definitely go back and stay w Patrick again. This is a lovely home close to transport and on the edge of the Doboce triangle. There are good restaurants and bars nearby. The host was away and although there were guests in another room for a couple of nights, I mostly had the apartment to myself. The room was clean and comfortable with ensuite. I would recommend it for someone wanting to stay in this area
It was nice place to stay. Patrick's kitchen and living was good. Every guests are kindness. It was very comfortable.  Beautiful home in a great, safe neighborhood. A really nice and cosy place to stay in SF. The public transportation is nearby so you get easily to the hotspots of San Francisco. Free parking in the weekend, but through the week you need to find a parking lot.

We didn't meet Patrick himself, but his cousin Brian was a really friendly co-host. We did text Patrick when we had some questions. He immediately responded! Patrick's home is beautiful and the location is great. Around the corner on Haight, there are several restaurants to try. We stayed for four nights and enjoyed our stay very much. Patrick was an awesome host. He was so attentive - very responsive via text and he proactively provided great recommendations and things to do across San Francisco.  Patrick's home is exactly as advertised - a haven of peace and tranquillity - and Patrick a gracious and helpful host. He knows the city well, provides suggestions and maps, and interesting books if you need to rest and relax. Location is close to multiple good dining options and public transport. I thoroughly recommend. We had a wonderful time staying at Patrick's place! He was polite and helpful, and the place itself was gorgeous. It is also a really fun neighborhood to be in. I felt like I got the true San Francisco experience. Would definitely stay again. Patrick's place was perfect for our trip to San Francisco. The room was a great size and very comfortable for two travellers. In a fantastic location, close to public transportation, as well as many restaurants and bars that we were excited to try. That being said, the place was still quiet and safe, although situated among nightlife. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great place to stay in SF! Very nice place to stay. Patrick is a wonderful host who thought of evertything (map of the city, informations about what you can do in SF, water available ...). The room is a bit small but we appreciated to have our own batheroom and the possibility to use the kitchen. Patrick's home is clean and beautifully decorated. He responds promptly to questions and made our stay welcoming. Patrick and Brian are strong communicators and gracious hosts. The home is beautiful and well situated in the middle of the city-easily accessible to everything. Patrick was a great host and a very welcoming person. The room was as described, very clean, comfortable and with good privacy. The area around is easy to navigate and very close to public transportation. Overall I had a great stay with Patrick and would recommend to anyone. Very nice stay at Patrick's place.
Very open and friendly host, who gives recommendations for the city and let us use the fridge and stuff in the kitchen.

The room is very nice and comfortable -though a bit small. Same for the rooms private bathroom: clean and equipped with everything you need, only small.

Communication was always quick and check-in was well organized. Patrick has a nice place well prepared for his guests. We always felt comfortable and the communucation was perfect. Thank you very much for everything. If we come back to San Francisco we contact you again :) First we have to say the location was perfect! Safe community and walkable distance to many spots including Alamo square, which is really close. Many good restaurants around and the community is full with SF typical style houses, colorful and beautiful. The owner is very caring, you can find everything you need at the place, clean and cozy. We will definitely go back! One thing, bring mosquito spray with you just in case. It was great staying at Patrick’s apartment! We would definetaly stay again if we come to SF again. Brian is a great host. The place is very beautiful, central, and you can find many  restaurants and shops just minutes away walking. It is also close to public transportation. We had an amazing time! Thanks Patrick and Brian for your hospitality. Great location - close to Church Street metro and variety of restaurants on Haight street and on Divisadero.

Extremely helpful and accommodating hosts.

I stayed here with my wife for two weeks and I honestly feel that choosing to stay at Patrick’s was the foundation for a memorable trip to SF.

We will be back on our next visit! Good, quite location. Staying at Patrick’s place was our first Airbnb. At first we were nervous staying in a strangers home but Patrick made it feel very inviting and homely. Although Patrick wasn’t there he was still available for any questions and his cousin Brian was there to let us in and inform us about the city. Overall Great place! Awesome location, very stylish place with great hospitality! Will be staying again if Patrick will have us. convinient and clean room. Patrick is very busy man but always be there answer my msg.
I would like to recommend it when a woman comes on a trip. or next room more than bigger.

The point is lovely town! Iza ramen is best ever in San francisco. Trust me. If you stay here, You have to go Iza ramen. :-)

수건도 교체해달라고 하면 해쥽미다. 뀨치먄 쌔탸끠 묘쎠용 I really enjoyed my stay at Patrick's house. He was a great host and you really could not ask for a better location in the city. The house is close to many great restaurants and shops. I mainly used Uber on this trip but there were also public transportation options nearby. I would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone planning a trip to SF. Patrick's place was great for my short stay in San Francisco. He has hosts two rooms in his home, I was fortunate enough to have a private bathroom of my own. The space was just as described and was exactly what I needed, fresh and clean linens, a shower, desk and he even provided a space heater to stay warm. Thanks for hosting me, Patrick!  Patrick is a wonderful host. His house is beautiful and very clean. I would most definitely stay there again. Patrick’s place is amazing! I loved all the decorations, it set the tone for my entire trip. My room was small, but it was enough just for me. It had a clean, comfortable bed and private bathroom, which was a huge plus for me. It was a bit cold in the apartment, but my room had a heater to keep me warm when I was in. Great location, 5 min walk to various cafes. I didn’t meet Patrick in person since he was traveling, but his cousin greeted me and was super friendly and helpful. Highly recommend this place! I will definitely book again next time I am in San Francisco Patrick的家很乾淨並且設備很好 He’s such a wonderful host. Patrick made my first experience amazing and set the expectation bar. I will certain recommend. Perfekst beliggenhed i meget dejligt område. Stille og fredelig lejlighed, Flot køkken. Værelset er lidt lille til 2 personer med kufferter. Men SF i januar er koldt og fugtigt. Patrick has a great place that is located next to some of the best places in the Haight. Very friendly, stylish, and clean. Patrick was a wonderful host. He has a beautiful home. Would definitely stay here again. I really enjoyed my stay with Patrick. He was flexible, and very welcoming. His home is a beautiful space, and the room was perfect for a relaxing weekend stay. I'd stay with Patrick again. A fantastic place to stay! Patrick's apartment is pristine and the decor is amazing - what a beautiful home! My room was sparkling clean and super comfy. I had everything I needed.""",22))
